TwitRSS.me
==========

[TwitRSS.me](https://twitrss.me) is a web service that let you generate an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) from your Twitter user timeline, or from a Twitter search.

It does this by connecting to Twitter on the web and screenscraping the data, rather than by using the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Installation
------------

You can install TwitRSS.me by following the instructions in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

The main reason for doing so is that the caching limits (one query every 45 minutes) is proving restrictive.

The most easiest way to use TwitRSS.me is just to clone this git-repository, build and run the image in docker:

      git clone <this repo>
      cp example.env .env
      vi .env
      docker-compose up -d --build

History
-------

You can see a bunch of [TwitRSS.me blog posts](http://charlieharvey.org.uk/tag/twitrss.me/) on Charlie Harvey's site. They mostly deal with me being increasingly freaked out about the amount of traffic that is turning up.
