TwitRSS.me
==========

[TwitRSS.me](https://twitrss.me) is a web service that let you generate an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) from your Twitter user timeline, or from a Twitter search.

It does this by connecting to Twitter on the web and screenscraping the data, rather than by using the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Installation
------------

You can install TwitRSS.me by following the instructions in the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/ciderpunx/twitrssme/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file.

The main reason for doing so is that the caching limits (one query every 45 minutes) is proving restrictive.

History
-------

You can see a bunch of [TwitRSS.me blog posts](http://charlieharvey.org.uk/tag/twitrss.me/) on Charlie Harvey's site. They mostly deal with me being increasingly freaked out about the amount of traffic that is turning up.
